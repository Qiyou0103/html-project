1. **Mobile Responsiveness and Scaling**:
    - The site uses a mobile-first approach with media queries for different viewport sizes (max-width: 992px, 768px, 480px).
    - The navigation bar becomes a hamburger menu on smaller screens (max-width: 992px).
    - Grids and flexbox are used for layout which are responsive by default (e.g., `skills-grid` and `projects-grid`).
    - The `skills-grid` uses `grid-template-columns: repeat(auto-fit, minmax(150px, 1fr));` which is responsive.
    - The `projects-grid` uses `grid-template-columns: repeat(auto-fit, minmax(350px, 1fr));` and then changes to `1fr` on mobile (max-width: 992px) meaning one column.
    - Font sizes use `clamp()` and relative units (rem, vw) for better scaling.
    - The hero section uses `min-height: 100vh` and `clamp` for the heading.
 2. **Cross-Browser Compatibility**:
    - The CSS uses variables (custom properties) which are well-supported in modern browsers.
    - Vendor prefixes are missing for some properties (like `backdrop-filter`). We should add `-webkit-backdrop-filter` for Safari.
    - The `scroll-behavior: smooth` is supported in most modern browsers but not in IE or older versions.
    - The use of `gap` with flexbox and grid is now widely supported, but note that older versions of some browsers might require prefixes (though not necessary for the latest).
    - The `backdrop-filter` property is not supported in Firefox by default (needs to be enabled) and requires `-webkit-` prefix for Safari.
    - The use of `position: sticky` for the navigation bar is well-supported.
 3. **CSS Formatting, Spacing, and Layout**:
    - The CSS uses a consistent set of spacing variables (e.g., `--spacing-md`, `--spacing-lg`).
    - The layout is centered with `max-width: 1200px` and `margin: 0 auto` for containers.
    - The use of `min-height: 100vh` for sections makes them full viewport height.
    - The `box-sizing: border-box` is applied globally for consistent box model.
    - The background patterns and gradients are applied to the body and sections.
    - The CSS is organized by sections and components.
